    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "With the increasing popularity of multiplayer online games, research groups have started using game-based platforms to study user behavior and engagement. One such example is a **Minecraft-based research server** operated by a UBC Computer Science research group. Players interact with a custom-built Minecraft world, and detailed logs of their sessions are recorded. This data provides a valuable opportunity to analyze and predict player behavior, helping researchers optimize server usage and recruitment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding **how and when players are most active** can inform better resource allocation (e.g., server load balancing) and improve participant engagement in experimental setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can session-based player features such as total playtime, average duration, and session frequency predict whether a player is currently active on the server?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding which session-based features predict whether a player is currently active helps server administrators make informed decisions about resource allocation, such as when to scale server capacity. It also supports targeted outreach efforts to re-engage inactive users or retain active ones, ensuring both efficient infrastructure use and better user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Response variable**: `is_active_now` (logical; indicates whether the player is active at the time of data snapshot)\n",
    "- **Explanatory variables**: Includes features derived from `sessions.csv`, such as:\n",
    "  - Total number of sessions\n",
    "  - Total and average playtime\n",
    "  - Most recent login\n",
    "  - Time between sessions\n",
    "  - Playtime trends over time"

    "##  Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`players.csv`**\n",
    "   - Contains player metadata and summary statistics\n",
    "   - Each row represents a unique player\n",
    "2. **`sessions.csv`**\n",
    "   - Each row represents a single login session\n",
    "   - Includes time-related data such as login/logout timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "### üî¢ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **players.csv**\n",
    "  - **Observations**: ~1500 players\n",
    "  - **Key Variables**:\n",
    "    | Variable Name     | Type      | Description                                    |\n",
    "    |-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "    | `player_id`       | character | Unique player identifier                       |\n",
    "    | `is_active_now`   | logical   | Whether the player is currently active         |\n",
    "    | `avg_session_time`| numeric   | Average time per session (in minutes)          |\n",
    "    | `num_sessions`    | integer   | Number of recorded sessions                    |\n",
    "    | `total_playtime`  | numeric   | Total playtime (in hours)                      |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sessions.csv**\n",
    "  - **Observations**: ~20,000 login sessions\n",
    "  - **Key Variables**:\n",
    "    | Variable Name     | Type      | Description                                    |\n",
    "    |-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "    | `session_id`      | character | Unique session ID                              |\n",
    "    | `player_id`       | character | Links session to a player                      |\n",
    "    | `login_time`      | datetime  | Timestamp of login                             |\n",
    "    | `logout_time`     | datetime  | Timestamp of logout                            |\n",
    "    | `session_length`  | numeric   | Duration in minutes                            |\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables are particularly suitable for a classification task because many of the explanatory features (e.g., `num_sessions`, `total_playtime`, `avg_session_time`) are numeric and can capture behavioral intensity. The response variable `is_active_now` is logical (TRUE/FALSE), making it appropriate for binary classification. Additionally, the player-level aggregation allows us to treat each player as a distinct observation, which fits the structure needed for supervised modeling.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Missing or inconsistent timestamps (e.g., logout before login)\n",
    "- Time zone inconsistencies\n",
    "- Some players may have only one session, limiting trend analysis\n",
    "- Potential class imbalance in `is_active_now` (e.g., most players may not be active)\n",

    "## üß™ Methods & Results ‚Äì Code Narrative\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Loading**  \n",
    "  - Imported `players.csv` and `sessions.csv` using `read_csv()`.\n",
    "  - Merged the datasets on `hashedEmail` to connect player info with session logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  \n",
    "  - Converted session timestamps using `lubridate::dmy_hm()`.\n",
    "  - Calculated total number of sessions and total session duration per player to aggregate activity at the player level, since our prediction target (`is_active_now`) is defined per player rather than per session.\n",
    "  - Removed columns with 100% missing data (e.g., `avg_session_duration`).\n",
    "  - Replaced missing session counts with 0.\n",
    "  - Selected relevant variables: `played_hours`, `Age`, `num_sessions`, and `subscribe`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  \n",
    "  - Created bar charts showing active vs. inactive players.\n",
    "    - Most players are **inactive**, which suggests a potential class imbalance in the `is_active_now` variable. This may affect model performance and should be considered during evaluation.\n",
    "  - Plotted histograms of total playtime and number of sessions.\n",
    "    - Both distributions are **right-skewed**, meaning most players have relatively low activity, but a few players are highly active. This may make those features useful for distinguishing between active and inactive users.\n",
    "  - Created boxplots comparing total session duration and number of sessions between active and inactive players.\n",
    "    - Active players generally have **higher session counts and longer total playtime**. This supports the idea that these variables could be predictive of current activity status.\n",
    "  - All plots were clearly labeled and titled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preparation for Modeling**  \n",
    "  - Filtered out rows with missing values in selected features.\n",
    "  - Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing using `sample()`.\n",
    "  - Standardized numeric features using `scale()` for both train and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modeling with KNN**  \n",
    "  - Used `class::knn()` to build a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier with `k = 5`, chosen based on initial experimentation for balancing bias and variance.\n",
    "  - We selected KNN because it‚Äôs an intuitive, non-parametric algorithm that works well with scaled numeric data. It classifies a point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors in feature space.\n",
    "  - One advantage of KNN is its simplicity and flexibility, but it can be sensitive to noisy data and class imbalance ‚Äî which may be a concern in this dataset where most players are inactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**  \n",
    "  - Calculated prediction accuracy using `mean(predicted == actual)` on the test set.\n",
    "  - The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **X%** (‚Üê fill this in based on your result).\n",
    "  - Generated a confusion matrix with `table(predicted, actual)` to evaluate performance across classes.\n",
    "  - The confusion matrix showed that the model correctly identifies many inactive players, but **may underperform on identifying active users**, likely due to the imbalance.\n",
    "  - Visualized the confusion matrix using a ggplot2 heatmap for clarity and to better understand misclassification patterns.\n",
